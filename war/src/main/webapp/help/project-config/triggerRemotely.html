  Enable this option if you would like to trigger new builds
  by accessing a special predefined URL (convenient for scripts).
  <p>One typical example
  for this feature would be to trigger new build from the source
  control system's hook script, when somebody has just committed
  a change into the repository, or from a script that parses
  your source control email notifications.</p>
  <p>You'll need to provide an authorization token in the form of
  a string so that only those who know it would be able to remotely
  trigger this project's builds.</p>
  <p>Your script will not be able to reach the trigger URL if your
  Jenkins instance is configured without the read permission for
  anonymous users. To circumvent this limitation please install the
  <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Build+Token+Root+Plugin" target="_blank">
  Build Token Root Plugin
  </a></p>
